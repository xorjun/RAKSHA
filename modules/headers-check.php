The above code is checking for two different types of anonymous bots: 
bots that do not send a User-Agent header and bots that have an invalid IP address.

First, it checks if the $settings['badbot_protection3'] is set to 1. 
If that is true then it will proceed to check for missing User-Agent headers and invalid IP addresses.

First, it checks if the useragent variable is empty, 
if it is then it will assume it's a bot that did not send a User-Agent header. 
It will then log the event, autoban the IP if that setting is on, and notify via email if the settings allow it. 
Then it will redirect the visitor to a specific page.

Then it checks if the IP address is valid using PHP filter_var function. If the IP address is invalid, 
then it will assume that it is an anonymous bot and proceeds to log the event, 
autoban the IP if that setting is on, and notify via email if the settings allow it. 
Then it will redirect the visitor to a specific page.

It's worth noting that the code is making use of some functions that are not shown here, 
such as "psec_logging", "psec_autoban", and "psec_mail" it would be good to check what these functions 
are doing and how they are implemented.
