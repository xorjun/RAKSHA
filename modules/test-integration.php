This code would output a simple CSS style and a message in HTML, which is intended to indicate that 
the website is protected by RAKSHA.
The CSS style element sets the style for an HTML element with the id "psec_confbox". 
This element is used to create a box displaying a message, and its properties set the position, 
border, background color, text alignment, font size, and width of the box.
The HTML element would show a message saying "This Website is Protected by RAKSHA", 
with a link to the RAKSHA's website, this text will be showing at the very top of the website 
(z-index: 99999), Which makes it clear that the site is protected by the security system.

Keep in mind that to have a valid and working code, the script should have included all the previous 
functions and configuration. Also, this message can be included in a common header file that is shared 
by all the pages of the site, so you don't have to include it in every single page of your site.
