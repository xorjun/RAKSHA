This code block is used to detect and protect against fake bots. It checks if a certain condition, 
$settings['badbot_protection2'] == 1, is true, indicating that fake bot protection is enabled.

Then it checks whether a $fake_bot variable equals to 1, 
this means this visitor is a fake bot according to the system.

Then, it logs the type of bot, "Fake Bot" and calls the psec_logging, psec_autoban, 
and psec_mail functions which handle logging, banning, and sending notifications via email. 
And then it redirect the client to a page "fakebot-detected.php".

It's likely that the functions psec_logging, psec_autoban and psec_mail are not defined in this code snippet 
and should be defined in a different file that's included here.
